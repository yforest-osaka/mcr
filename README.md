# Nontrivial multi-product commutation relation for reducing T-count in sequential Pauli-based computation

Quantum compiler benchmark using dataset generated by multi-product commutation relation.

## Requirements

Quantum circuit unoptimization operates on Python 3.11, and the required dependencies are managed using `uv`. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yforest-osaka/mcr.git
    cd mcr
    ```

2. Install `uv` if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    brew install uv
    ```

3. Use `uv` to install the dependencies and create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

Now your environment is ready for running the benchmarks.
