# A multi-product commutation relation (MCR) for transpiling Clifford+T circuits

Quantum compiler benchmark using dataset generated by multi-product commutation relation.

## Requirements

Quantum circuit unoptimization operates on Python 3.11, and the required dependencies are managed using `poetry`. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yforest-osaka/mcr.git
    cd mcr
    ```

2. Install `poetry` if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```

3. Use `poetry` to install the dependencies and create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

Now your environment is ready for running the benchmarks.
